            <p>
                I spent 3 years learning full-stack JavaScript and responsive UI design in my spare time. 
                I studied Spanish Education in college thinking I was putting my language learning aptitude to the best use, 
                but Iâ€™ve found myself much more excited by using programming languages to build cool web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                I put this interest to good use as a Functional QA Analyst, creating proprietary testing technology and using my bug-fixing 
                experience to assess possible root causes of UI bugs found during testing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, as a Quality Automation Engineer, I learned how to apply my coding skills to the QA world, while still assisting 
                with functional testing efforts in the anti-fraud area of the company. I began learning Ruby, RSpec, Python, and Pytest as 
                tools to help me accomplish these goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an SDET, I'm learning how to collaborate effectively with other developers and support functional QA with my work. 
                My role is now devoted 100% to developing tests for the mobile app and back-end services. I also co-lead an apprenticeship 
                program to help aspiring SDETs learn the test automation craft.
            </p>
            <p> 
                I married the love of my life, Sam Martylewski, on October 30, 2021, after almost 4 years together! 
                My wife has always been super supportive of all my coding efforts and is my greatest inspiration. 
                When I'm not working, I'm enjoying life with her and our cat, Minnie!
